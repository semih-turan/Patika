## Patika Development Journey
This repository serves as an extensive compilation of the projects and practice sessions completed throughout my journey with Patika. As I advance through the program, each project and practice session is thoughtfully arranged into specific folders within this repository.

## Purpose
This repository serves as a comprehensive record of my learning journey, designed to document progress and provide a reference point for personal reflection and potential collaboration. Through its centralized structure, I aim to create an organized and accessible archive of my coding pursuits.
